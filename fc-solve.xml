<title>Introduction</title>
<simpara>This is Freecell Solver version 5.0.x, a program that automatically
solves most layouts of Freecell, and similar Solitaire variants as
well as those of Simple Simon.</simpara>

<refsection xml:id="usage">
<title>Usage</title>
<simpara>The program is called "fc-solve". You invoke it like this:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">fc-solve board_file</literallayout>
<simpara>board_file is the filename with a valid Freecell startup board. The file is
built as follows:</simpara>
<simpara>It has the 8 Freecell stacks.</simpara>
<simpara>Each stack contains its cards separated by a whitespace
and terminated with a newline character( it&#8217;s important that the last stack
will also be terminated with a newline !). The cards in the line are ordered
from the topmost card (= the card right on the virtual table and the one with
the most cards placed on it) in the left, to the bottommost card in the right
(= the card with no other cards placed on it).</simpara>
<simpara>A card string contains the rank of the card followed by its suit.
The card number is one of: <literal>A,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K</literal>. Alternatively,
<literal>T</literal> can be used instead of <literal>10</literal>. The card suit is one of:  <literal>H,S,D,C</literal> (standing
for Hearts, Spades, Diamonds and Clubs respectively).</simpara>
<simpara>Here is an example board: (PySol/Microsoft board No. 24)</simpara>
<screen>4C 2C 9C 8C QS 4S 2H
5H QH 3C AC 3H 4H QD
QC 9S 6H 9H 3S KS 3D

7H JS KH 10S KC 7C

</imageobject>
<textobject><phrase>Freecell Deal No. 24</phrase></textobject>
</inlinemediaobject></simpara>
<simpara>As can be seen, the four of clubs (4C), five of hearts (5H), etc. are at the
bottom of the stacks and the start of the lines in the board input.</simpara>
<simpara>And another one: (PySol board No. 198246790)</simpara>

<simpara>Starting from Freecell Solver 3.14.x, a stack can also start with a leading
colon (":"). This is to allow input from states as output by Freecell Solver
using the -p option.</simpara>
<simpara>You can specify the contents of the freecells by prefixing the line with
"FC:" or with "Freecells:". For example:</simpara>
<screen>FC: 3H QC</screen>
<simpara>will specify that the cards 3 of hearts and queen of clubs are present in
the freecells. To specify an empty freecell use a "-" as its designator.</simpara>
<simpara>If there&#8217;s another "FC:" line, the previous line will be overridden.</simpara>
<simpara>You can specify the contents of the foundations by prefixing the line with
"Founds:" or with "Foundations:" and then using a format as follows:</simpara>
<screen>Founds: H-5 C-A S-0 D-K</screen>
<simpara>Hence, the suit ID followed by a dash followed by the card number in the
foundation. A suit that is not present will be assumed to be 0. Again, if
there&#8217;s more than one line like that, then the previous lines will be
ignored and overridden.</simpara>
<simpara>The program will stop processing the input as soon as it read 8 lines of
standard stacks. Therefore, it is recommended that the foundations and
freecells lines will come at the beginning of the file.</simpara>
<simpara>The program will process the board and try to solve it. If it succeeds it
will output the states from the initial board to its final solution to the
standard output. If it fails, it will notify it.</simpara>
<simpara>For information about the various command-line switches that Freecell
Solver accepts, read the <literal>USAGE.txt</literal> file in this directory.</simpara>
<simpara>To solve Simple Simon boards append <literal>--game simple_simon</literal> right after
the "fc-solve" program name.</simpara>
</refsection>
<refsection xml:id="board_gen_programs">
<title>The board generation programs</title>
<simpara>Several programs which can generate the initial boards of various Freecell
implementations can be found in the "board_gen/" sub-directory. Read the
<literal>README.txt</literal> file there for details on how they can be compiled and used.</simpara>
<simpara>In any case, they can save you the time of inputting the board yourself.</simpara>

<title>How to read the solutions</title>
<simpara>The file <literal>USAGE.txt</literal> covers all of Freecell Solver’s command line options,
but it may be too exhaustive for casual users. As a result, here is a shorter
tutorial. First of all whenever invoking <literal>fc-solve</literal> one should add the
flags <literal>-p -t -sam -sel</literal> which will make the solution easier to understand. Then,
assuming the board could be successfully solved, one will be given the layouts
in the solution (in the format given above) vis-a-vis with the moves as the
string. Note that the indexes of the resources given in the moves are
0-based rather than the more natural 1-based notation.</simpara>
</refsection>
<refsection xml:id="_the_programs">
<title>The programs</title>
<simpara>Most command-line switches have two versions:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>A short POSIX one which is a dash followed by a letter or a few. This option
must come standalone and not clustered:  <literal>-sam</literal> is not equivalent to
specifying <literal>-s</literal>, <literal>-a</literal> and <literal>-m</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>A long switch which is two dashes followed by the command string. For
example: <literal>--prelude</literal>, <literal>--st-name</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>If command line arguments have parameters, they are followed in separate
parameters - Freecell Solver won&#8217;t recognise a parameter preceded by an equal
sign. <literal>--st-name=myname</literal> is invalid, while <literal>--st-name myname</literal> is OK.</simpara>

<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Global</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Freecell Solver re-arranges the stacks and freecells in a given state
according to their first card. It keeps their actual position in a
separate place, but internally it uses their canonized place. Use
this option, if you want Freecell Solver to display them in that order.
One should be warned that that way the place of a given stack in the
board will not be preserved throughout the solution.</simpara>

<refsection xml:id="display-moves_flag">
<title>-m , --display-moves</title>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Global</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>This option will display the moves instead of the intermediate states.
Each move will be displayed in a separate line, in a format that is
human-readable, but that can also be parsed and analyzed by a computer
program with some effort on the programmer&#8217;s part.</simpara>
<simpara>For example:</simpara>
<screen>$ pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board 24 | fc-solve -m | head -30

<simpara>Manipulating the moves order can be very helpful to the quick solution
of a given board. If you found that a certain board cannot be solved in
after a long time or in a certain maximal number of iterations, you
should try different moves' orders. Usually, one can find a moves order
that solves a board very quickly.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that this moves order usually makes sense only for the Soft-DFS
and Random DFS scans (see the <literal>--method</literal> option below).</simpara>
<simpara>Also note that Freecell moves are not suitable for solving Simple Simon games
and Simple Simon moves are not suitable for solving anything except Simple
Simon.</simpara>
<simpara>Moves can be grouped together into groups using parenthesis
(e.g: "(0123)") or square brackets ("[012][3456789]"). Such grouping is
only relevant to the Random DFS scan (see below). A group may optionally
be followed by the equal sign "=" and by an ordering specifier. If one
specifies "=rand()", then the derived states will be randomised based on the
seed (which is what happens if no equal sign is specified). On the other
hand, if one specifies something like "=asw(5,0,5,0,0,5)", then the numbers
inside the parentheses will be treated as weights for the same ordering
function used by the <literal>-asw</literal> flag (see below).</simpara>
</refsection>
<refsection xml:id="depth-tests-order2_flag">
<title>-dto2 [Min Depth],[Moves' Order] , --depth-tests-order2 [Min Depth],[Moves' Order]</title>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Soft-thread-specific</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Sets the Moves' order starting from the minimal depth onwards. This way, if
a Soft-DFS scan recurses deeply into the game, it will use a different moves'
order.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that if you set the moves' order of a minimal depth of say 50, then it
will override all the moves' order of 50 and above. As a result, it is
recommended that you set the minimal depth moves order in an increasing
depth.</simpara>
<simpara>It should be noted that the <literal>-to</literal> or <literal>--tests-order</literal> option above is
equivalent to using this option with a minimal depth of 0.</simpara>
<simpara>Here are some examples:</simpara>
<screen>-to 0123456789 -dto2 30,0138924567</screen>
<simpara>This sets the moves' order to <literal>0123456789</literal> for all depths below 30 and to
<literal>0138924567</literal> for all depths above it.</simpara>
<screen>-to 0123457 -dto2 10,750123 -dto2 25,710235</screen>
<simpara>This sets the moves' order to <literal>0123457</literal> for depths -9 (those below 10),
to <literal>750123</literal> for depths 10-24, and to <literal>710235</literal> for the depths 25 onwards.</simpara>
<screen>-to 0123457 -dto2 "10,[012357]=asw(1)"</screen>
<simpara>This sorts the moves starting from 10 onward based on the asw() function.</simpara>
<screen>-to 0123457 -dto2 "10,[012357]=rand()"</screen>
<simpara>This randomises the moves from 10 onward.</simpara>
<screen>-to 0123457 -dto2 "10,[012357]"</screen>
<simpara>This does the same thing as the previous example.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Note</emphasis> : This option should be used instead of the older <literal>-dto</literal> option given

<refsection xml:id="depth-tests-order_flag">

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>soft-dfs</literal> - A "soft" DFS scan</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Starting from recent Freecell Solver versions there is no difference between
<literal>dfs</literal> and <literal>soft-dfs</literal>. In earlier versions, use of <literal>soft-dfs</literal> is recommended.
<literal>random-dfs</literal> is similar to <literal>soft-dfs</literal> only it determines to which states to
recurse into randomly. Its behaviour will differ depending on the seed you
supply to it.  (see the "-seed" option below.)</simpara>
<simpara>BFS does not yield good results, and <literal>a-star</literal> has a mixed behaviour, so for
the time being I recommend using Soft-DFS or Random-DFS.</simpara>
<simpara>The Random-DFS scan processes every moves' random group, randomizes the
states that it found and recurses into them one by one. Standalone moves
that do not belong to any group, are processed in a non-random manner.</simpara>

one would run and so on. One use of it is to run an atomic moves scan
after a meta-moves scan, so we will always get an accurate verdict and
still enjoy some of the speed benefits of the meta-moves scan.</simpara>

<refsection xml:id="next-flare_flag">
<title>-nf , --next-flare</title>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Instance-wide</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Each instance contains several flares. Flares are various alternative scans,
that are ran one after another, as specified in the <literal>--flares-plan</literal> below
or defaulting to running only the first flare (which isn&#8217;t very useful). Out
of all the flares that are successful in solving a board, Freecell Solver
picks the one with the shortest solution.</simpara>
</refsection>
<refsection xml:id="flare-name_flag">
<title>--flare-name [flare name]</title>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Flare-wide</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>This is a name that identifies the flare for use in the flares' plan.</simpara>
</refsection>
<refsection xml:id="flares-plan_flag">
<title>--flares-plan [flare plan]</title>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Instance-wide</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>This instance-wide parameter gives a plan for the flares as a big string. Here
are some examples:</simpara>
<screen>--flares-plan "RunIndef:FlareyFlare"</screen>
<simpara>This plan will run the flare with the name <literal>FlareyFlare</literal> indefinitely, until it
terminates. Once a RunIndef action is encountered, the rest of the plan is
ignored.</simpara>
<screen>--flares-plan "Run:500@MyFlare,Run:2000@FooFlare"</screen>
<simpara>Runs <literal>MyFlare</literal> for 500 iterations and <literal>FooFlare</literal> for 2,000
iterations. Note that both flares will be run and won&#8217;t share any resources
between them, and then the minimal solution out of both flares (or only
those that finished ). If no flares finished, then Freecell Solver will run
them both again for the same number of iterations each, until at least one
finishes (or it ran out of the iterations' limit).</simpara>
<screen>--flares-plan "Run:500@dfs,Run:1500@befs,CP:,Run:10000@funky"</screen>
<simpara>This runs the flares identified by <literal>dfs</literal> and <literal>befs</literal> and then see if a solution
was reached ("CP:" stands for <emphasis role="strong">"checkpoint"</emphasis>), and if so yield it. If both
flares did not reach a solution yet, or failed to solve the board, it will run
the flare <literal>funky</literal> for 10,000 iterations and yield its solution. And like the
previous case, this solution will loop after it ended for as long as the
no flare solved the board or the program did not run out of iterations.</simpara>
<simpara>Using checkpoints one can yield a possibly sub-optimal (as far as solution
length is concerned) solution that will still solve faster than letting all
the flares run.</simpara>
</refsection>
<refsection xml:id="flares-choice_flag">
<title>--flares-choice [choice]</title>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Global</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>This dictates how to choose the winning flare based on if more than one yielded
a solution. Possible options are:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>--flares-choice fc_solve</literal> - the default, which picks up the solutions based
on the length of the solution in Freecell Solver&#8217;s moves.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>--flares-choice fcpro</literal> - picks up the shortest solution based on the
number of Freecell Pro moves, while not considering implicit moves to the

</refsection>
<refsection xml:id="flares-iters-factor_flag">
<title>-fif [factor] , --flares-iters-factor [factor]</title>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Global</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Sets a global, floating-point number, factor to multiply all the iterations
counts in the flares plans. The higher it is, the longer the scans will take,
but there is a greater chance more of them will succeed, and, as a result,
the solution may be shorter.</simpara>
<simpara>As an example, the following:</simpara>
<screen>--flares-plan "Run:500@MyFlare,Run:2000@FooFlare" --flares-iters-factor 2</screen>
<simpara>Is equivalent to:</simpara>
<screen>--flares-plan "Run:1000@MyFlare,Run:4000@FooFlare"</screen>
<simpara>while:</simpara>
<screen>--flares-plan "Run:500@MyFlare,Run:2000@FooFlare" --flares-iters-factor 0.5</screen>
<simpara>Is equivalent to:</simpara>

</refsection>
<refsection xml:id="cache-limit_flag">
<title>--cache-limit [cache limit]</title>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Global</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>This is a numeric limit to the LRU cache which only matters if Freecell
Solver was compiled with <literal>FCS_RCS_STATES</literal> enabled. This value should be
a positive integer and the higher it is, the more quickly it is likely
that Freecell Solver will run, but it will also consume more memory. (The

<refsection xml:id="read-from-file_flag">
<title>--read-from-file [num_skip,]filename</title>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Global</emphasis> (but context-specific).</simpara>
<simpara>This option will read the configuration options from a file. The format
of the file is similar to that used by the UNIX Bourne Shell. (i.e:
spaces denote separate arguments, double-quotes encompass arguments,
backslash escapes characters).</simpara>
<simpara>The filename can be preceded by an optional number of the arguments to
skip followed by a comma. (the default is 0)</simpara>
</refsection>
<refsection xml:id="load-config_flag">

<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Global</emphasis> (but context-specific).</simpara>
<simpara>Reads the configuration specified by [preset] and configures the solver
accordingly. A preset is a set of command line arguments to be analyzed
in the place of this option. They are read from a set of presetrc files
: one installed system-wide, the other at $HOME/.freecell-solver/presetrc
and the third at the path specified by the FREECELL_SOLVER_PRESETRC
environment variable. You can add more presets at any of these places.

<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Global</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>This option tells fc-solve to print the iteration number and the
recursion depth of every state which is checked, to the standard
output. It&#8217;s a good way to keep track of how it&#8217;s doing, but the output
slows it down a bit.</simpara>

<simpara>Prints the current iteration if <literal>-i</literal> is specified, only every <literal>[step]</literal>
steps, where <literal>[step]</literal> is a positive integer. For example, if you do
<literal>fc-solve -i --iter-output-step 100</literal>, you will see this:</simpara>
<screen>Iteration: 0
Iteration: 100

<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Global</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>This option implies -i. If specified, this option outputs the cards and
formation of the board itself, for every state that is checked.
"fc-solve -s" yields a nice real-time display of the progress of
Freecell Solver, but you usually cannot make what is going on because
it is so fast.</simpara>

<title>Signal Combinations</title>
<simpara>If you are working on a UNIX or a similar system, then you can set some
run-time options in "fc-solve" by sending it some signal
combinations.</simpara>
<simpara>If you send the fc-solve a single ABRT signal, then fc-solve will terminate
the scan prematurely, and report that the iterations’s limit has been
exceeded.</simpara>
<simpara>If you send the signal USR1, without sending any other signals before
that, then <literal>fc-solve</literal> will output the present number of
iterations. This method is a good way to monitor an instance that takes
a long time to solve.</simpara>
<simpara>If you send it the signal USR2 and then USR1, then <literal>fc-solve</literal>
will print the iteration number and depth on every state that it
checks. It is the equivalent of specifying (or unspecifying) the
option -i/--iter-output.</simpara>
<simpara>If you send it two USR2 signals and then USR1, then <literal>fc-solve</literal>
will also print the board of every state. Again, this will only be done
assuming the iteration output is turned on.</simpara>
