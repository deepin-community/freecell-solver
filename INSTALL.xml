<title>Quick and Dirty Compilation</title>
<simpara>Freecell Solver was converted to use CMake ( <link xl:href="http://www.cmake.org/">http://www.cmake.org/</link> )
starting from version 2.12.0. You&#8217;ll need to install CMake version 3
or later from your distribution&#8217;s repository or from its source
distribution.</simpara>
<simpara>If you are building from the repository, you also need to put the
module <literal>Shlomif_Common.cmake</literal> from
<link xl:href="https://bitbucket.org/shlomif/shlomif-cmake-modules">https://bitbucket.org/shlomif/shlomif-cmake-modules</link> in the CMake path.
Normally the build process will try to download it and use it for you.</simpara>
<simpara>Next, run:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">cmake-gui .         # For the GUI configuration applet</literallayout>
<simpara>Or:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">ccmake .            # For the Curses-based configuration applet</literallayout>
<simpara>With a fallback to:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">cmake .             # Non-interactive application.</literallayout>
<simpara>This will build and install the "freecell-solver" shared library,
and "fc-solve" which is the Freecell Solver executable for you.</simpara>
<simpara>It will also build and install the board generation program. More
information about them can be found in the "board_gen" sub-directory of
this distribution.</simpara>

<title>Changing the Maximal number of Freecells or Stacks or Cards per Stack</title>
<simpara>The following parameters to the CMake script, which accept an argument,
control the hard-coded parameters of the Freecell Solver executables:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>-DMAX_NUM_FREECELLS=$NUM</literal> - The maximal number of freecells</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>-DMAX_NUM_STACKS=$NUM</literal> - The maximal number of stacks (columns)</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>-DMAX_NUM_INITIAL_CARDS_IN_A_STACK=$NUM</literal> - The maximal number of
initial cards per stack.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Notice that it&#8217;s very important to set the maximal number of initial cards
per stack, or else it&#8217;s possible that a stack will eventually overflow.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="compact_states">
<title><emphasis role="marked">"Compact" States</emphasis></title>
<simpara>In Compact States, the contents of the card stacks are stored inside the
states, rather than in a central collection (where the states contain only
pointers). Despite their name, they actually consume more memory than Indirect
Stack States which are the default.</simpara>
<simpara>Compact states used to be faster than Indirect Stack States, but now it
seems indirect stack states are at least slightly faster even for games
whose stacks are not very long. If you still would wish to enable it,
pass the <literal>-DSTATES_TYPE=COMPACT_STATES</literal> flag to CMake.</simpara>

<title>Installing under Win32</title>
<simpara>Consult the CMake documentation for generating a Visual C++ , MinGW32
etc. compatible makefile or project.</simpara>

<section xml:id="testing">
<title>Testing</title>
<simpara>To test Freecell Solver, you need to:</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>Configure it.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Run <literal>make install</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Type <literal>ctest -V</literal> (or <literal>make test</literal> just for the verdict).</simpara>
